# Prevention of Sexual Harassment


---

### 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes any unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature that makes someone feel offended, humiliated, or intimidated. This may include:

- Inappropriate touching, patting, or brushing against a person  
- Sexually suggestive comments, jokes, or gestures  
- Displaying sexually explicit images, posters, or screensavers  
- Making lewd remarks, innuendos, or propositions  
- Sending unwanted sexual messages via email, chat, or social media  
- Repeated requests for dates despite being declined  
- Staring, leering, or making someone feel physically unsafe  

Such behaviors—whether verbal, physical, written, or visual—can contribute to a hostile work environment.

### 2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If I face or witness any sexual harassment incident:

- **Document the incident**: Note down details such as date, time, place, people involved, and what was said or done.  
- **Report to the Internal Committee (IC)** or PoSH team as mentioned in the organization’s policy.  
- **Support the victim** if I am a witness, by encouraging them to speak up or offering to accompany them when reporting.  
- **Avoid gossiping or retaliating** against any party involved.  
- **Respect confidentiality** of the complaint and investigation process.  

The focus is to **speak up**, **act promptly**, and **use the official channels** provided by the organization, such as the Internal Committee or HR.
