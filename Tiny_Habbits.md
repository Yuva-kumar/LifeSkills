# Tiny Habits

## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg
The most interesting idea was starting with small, simple habits and adding them to things you already do. This makes habits easier and more natural.

## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message  
The B = MAP formula (Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt) says that a habit happens when motivation and ability meet the right trigger. Getting these three right makes a habit easier to do.

- **M:** Motivation  
- **A:** Ability  
- **P:** Prompt  

## 3. Shine or Celebrate  
Celebrating small wins after completing a habit makes it feel good, helping the habit stick and encouraging you to do it again.

## 4. 1% Better Every Day Video  
The idea of getting just **1% better every day** is powerful because small improvements add up over time.

### Question 5: Identity  
The book says to focus on the person you want to become (e.g., a "healthy person") instead of just the goal. This makes habits easier to keep.

### Question 6: Making a Habit Easier  
Make it easy by reducing effort. For example, keep things ready for the habit, like laying out your workout clothes the night before.

Make it harder by adding obstacles, like putting your phone away so itâ€™s not easy to check.
